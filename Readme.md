# Getting Started
### Basic Understanding
    - Hello 
    - data types
    - declaring multiple variable
    - string and operations on string
### Math 
    - max
    - min
    - sqrt
### Array
    - Array of single data type
    - Array of mulitiple data type
### Functions
    - Basic Func

        - contains
        - sort => Collections.sort(arrayname)
    - Hashmap
        - put
        - get
        - loop over hashmap => (Imp**)
    -  Set-HashSet => every item in a set has to be unique
        rest same like arraylist
    - Immutablelist
    - Concept Of Optional => to handle null pointer error => means when the output is null
